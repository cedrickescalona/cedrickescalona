- 👋 Hi, I’m @cedrickescalona, Developer Jr. and lover of cold coffee ☕.

In my free time, I'm dedicated to exploring multiple programming languages, and creating projects that make it easier for students to perform various processes. 

Here's a little bit about my work 🖥💻📱

- 👀 I’m very interested in topics related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science and engineering applications in the area of exact sciences.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning some programming languages, and the operation of mechanical and electronic systems 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of automated systems that optimize time, resources and improve the quality of life of people
